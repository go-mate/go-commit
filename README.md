## CHINESE README

[中文说明](README.zh.md)

## Key Features

🎯 **Quick Commit Automation**: Intelligent staging, formatting, and committing with amend support  
⚡ **Auto Go Formatting**: Selective formatting of changed Go files with generated file exclusion  
🔄 **Signature-info Management**: Automatic Git signature selection based on remote URL patterns  
🌍 **Wildcard Patterns**: Sophisticated pattern matching for complex enterprise workflows  
📋 **Configuration-Driven**: JSON-based configuration with priority-based signature matching

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/go-mate/go-commit/cmd/go-commit@latest
```

## Usage

```bash
# Quick commit with Go formatting
go-commit -m "some commit message" --format-go

# With signature info
go-commit -u "username" -e "example@example.com" -m "message" --format-go

# Use configuration file for auto choose signature info
go-commit -c "xx/xx/go-commit-config.json" -m "commit message" --format-go

# Amend previous commit
go-commit --amend -m "updated message" --format-go

# Force amend (even pushed to origin)
go-commit --amend --force -m "force amend message"
```

## Configuration

Using a configuration file is optional but enables advanced features like automatic signature switching based on the project's remote URL.

To get started, you can generate a configuration template based on your current git remote:

```bash
# This creates a go-commit-config.json in your current directory
go-commit config example
```

This file allows you to define signatures for different git remotes. It looks like this:

```json
{
  "signatures": [
    {
      "name": "work-github", "username": "work-user", "eddress": "work@company.com", "remotePatterns": [
      "git@github.company.com:*"
    ]
    },
    {
      "name": "play-github", "username": "play-user", "eddress": "play@example.com", "remotePatterns": [
      "git@github.com:play-user/*"
    ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Examples:

- Project A with remote `git@github.company.com:team/project-a` → auto commits as work-user(work@company.com)
- Project B with remote `git@github.com:play-user/project-b` → auto commits as play-user(play@example.com)

This automatic switching makes multi-project workflow much more convenient.

**Validate Configuration:**

Once setting up your configuration, you can validate it:

```bash
# Check if config loads correctly and preview matched signature
go-commit config -c /path/to/go-commit-config.json
```

More advanced use cases. See the [configuration examples](internal/examples/).

## Recommended Aliases

```bash
# Quick commit with formatting
alias gcm='go-commit --username=yourname --format-go'

# Quick amend with formatting
alias gca='go-commit --username=yourname --format-go --amend'
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Commit with message and Go formatting
gcm -m "add new feature"

# Amend last commit
gca

# Change last commit
gca -m "new commit message"

# Force amend (dangerous - use with caution)
gca -m "force update pushed to remote" --force
```
